{"name":"jQueryvsDojo","tagline":"A juxtaposition of various jQuery and Dojo methods","body":"# jQuery vs Dojo\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of places to find comparisons of jQuery and pre – Dojo 1.7 methods but I wanted to have a place to compare jQuery with Dojo’s AMD style.\r\n\r\nIf you ever find yourself needing to convert a jQuery laden web page to one that uses AMD style Dojo (or vise verse), it helps to have a quick little comparison guide to aid the process. That's what this is. \r\n\r\nWell, that's what it will be - as soon as I actually finish it.\r\n<a id=\"top\"></a>\r\n[Select By Id](#select-by-id)\r\n[Select By Class](#select-by-class)\r\n\r\n## ***Select By Id***\r\n### jQuery\r\n    $(“#idName”)\r\n### Dojo\r\n    Require([“dojo/dom”], function(dom){\r\n        dom.byId(“idName”)\r\n    })\r\n\r\nBoth methods return the element with id “idName”. Dojo's dom.byId is just an alias for document.getElementById. This means anything you can do with an element retrieved through getElementById you can do with an element accessed through dom.byId.\r\n([Back to top](#top)) \r\n<br>\r\n\r\n## ***Select By Class***\r\n### *Also select by pseudo class or element*\r\n### jQuery\r\n    //query by class\r\n    $(“.className”)\r\n\r\n    //query by element\r\n    $(“div”)\r\n\r\n    //query by pseudo Class\r\n    $(“.className:first-child”)\r\n\r\n### Dojo\r\n    Require([“dojo/query”], function(query){\r\n    //query by class\r\n    query(“.className”)\r\n\r\n    //query by element\r\n    query(“div”)\r\n\r\n    //query by pseudo Class\r\n    query(“.className:first-child”)\r\n})\r\n\r\njQuery’s class selector actually selects all elements with that class so if you chain a method onto the end of the selector, the method will affect every element with that class name. \r\nDojo’s query, on the other hand, returns a nodeList which you then have to loop through to access the individual elements in it.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
