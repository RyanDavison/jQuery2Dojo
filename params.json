That's what this is. \r\n\r\nWell, that's what it will be - as soon as I actually finish it.\r\n\r\n[Select By Id](#select-by-id)\r\n\r\n## **Select By Id**\r\n### jQuery\r\n    $(“#idName”)\r\n### Dojo\r\n    Require([“dojo/dom”], function(dom){\r\n        dom.byId(“idName”)\r\n    })\r\n\r\nBoth methods return the element with id “idName”. Dojo's dom.byId is just an alias for document.getElementById. This means anything you can do with an element retrieved through getElementById you can do with an element accessed through dom.byId.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
